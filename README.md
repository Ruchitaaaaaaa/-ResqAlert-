# ResQAlert   
**Real-Time Animal Rescue and Reporting System**  
_MCA Group Project | Android (Java), Firebase, Node.js, Express, Google Maps API_  

---

##  Introduction
Every day, countless stray or injured animals go unnoticed due to the lack of fast and accessible reporting systems. **ResQAlert** bridges this gap by enabling users to report animal emergencies with a single tap.  

The system combines **real-time GPS tracking, image uploads, push notifications, and admin dashboards** to connect citizens, rescuers, and NGOs â€” ensuring efficient and coordinated animal rescue.  

---

##  Objectives
- One-tap animal SOS with image and GPS location  
- Real-time notifications to nearby verified rescuers  
- Track rescue case status (Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Resolved)  
- Admin panel for operational control and analytics  
- Adoption listings, donations, and volunteer dashboards  
- Modular design for future upgrades (e.g., AI-based injury detection)
