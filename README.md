# ResQAlert ðŸš¨
**Real-Time Animal Rescue and Reporting System**  
_MCA Group Project | Android (Java), Firebase, Node.js, Express, Google Maps API_

---

##  Introduction
Every day, countless stray or injured animals go unnoticed due to the lack of fast and accessible reporting systems. **ResQAlert** bridges this gap by enabling users to report animal emergencies with a single tap. The app uses real-time GPS tracking, image uploads, push notifications, and admin dashboards to connect citizens, rescuers, and NGOs â€” ensuring efficient and coordinated animal rescue.

---

##  Objectives
- One-tap animal SOS with image and GPS location
- Real-time notifications to nearby verified rescuers
- Track rescue case status (Pending â†’ In Progress â†’ Resolved)
- Admin panel for operational control and data reports
- Modules for adoption listings, donations, and volunteer dashboards
- Modular design for future upgrades (e.g., AI-based injury detection)
